# SpringSecureLabFrontend

## Overview

SpringSecureLabFrontend is a React-based frontend application designed to interact with the SpringSecureLab backend. This project serves as an educational tool for exploring modern web application security concepts, particularly focusing on secure communication between client and server.

The application is built using VITE, React, and TypeScript, offering a robust and dynamic user experience while consuming secure APIs provided by the SpringSecureLab backend.

## Features

- **React Framework**: Utilizes the latest features of React for building interactive UIs.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Leverages TypeScript for type-safe code and better developer experience.
- **VITE Build Tool**: Employs VITE for fast and efficient module bundling and development experience.
